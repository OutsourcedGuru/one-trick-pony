  h1= title
  p This is a limited DNS server which only serves up the minimum set of required servers for Agar.io game play but not for its associated ads, for example. This should allow you to play the game without disruptions, without loss of earned experience points and without the buggy ad-related code which should make it easier to play without those frequent game crashes.
  p(style="margin:0") Current configuration:
  p(style="margin:0") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;webserver: *:#{webPort}
  p(style="margin:0") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DNS server: #{dnsAddr}:#{dnsPort}
  p You can alter the port(s) the server listens to in the 
    b config/index.js 
    | file.
    | Note that if you use the default port of 53 for the dnsPort or port 80 for 
    | the webDefaultPort then you'll need to run 
    b node 
    | in the superuser mode. See the section for running with the default 
    | ports.
  p Also note that the DNS server's IP address is by default set to 127.0.0.1 
    | which results in the server binding to only its internal address. 
    | Setting it to your external address is expected during installation 
    | to allow another game computer to use it.

  h3 Running the DNS server with the test ports 3000 and 3001
  hr
  p Ports 3000 and 3001 are useful for testing things since they don't require privileged-level ports and can be run by a standard user.

  h3 Running the DNS server with the default ports of 53 and 80
  hr
  p Although 3000 and 3001 are fine for testing things, the default DNS port of 
    | 53 is a privileged-level port and can only be run by superusers. The same 
    | is true for port 80 for the web server.
  h4 Linux work-around
  p There is a work-around on Linux servers called 
    b setcap
    |  which allows 
    b node
    |  to run in the privileged-level port space. Note that in the command 
    | below, the first pairing are apostrophes and the second pairing are 
    | called "backticks" and the key is usually to the left of the number 
    | 1 in the upper row.
  div(style="background-color:black;color:white")
    pre
      | $ 
      b sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' `which node`
      | 
      | 
  p This should allow 
    b npm start
    |  to run without complaining about an 
    b EACCES
    |  error.

    | and then run

    |  a slightly different way by giving it the full path to the program

  h3 Cool things you can now do
  hr
  p The easiest thing you could do now is to point your game computer's DNS to only 
    | your new server. In this way, your Agar.io game can only talk to the game 
    | server but fails in its attempts to talk to the many ad servers, metrics and 
    | analytics servers. Take a look at how busy the game is in trying to reach out 
    | to these unnecessary servers...

  p Now that you *own* the DNS server, you have more control than you probably think you do. 
    | You can now change the regions if you'd like in the 
    b bin/www
    |  file within the dns_handler() function itself. Use 
    b nslookup
    |  locally to find out how the various entries resolve for you and update 
    | your code if you'd like. Since I'm here in SOCAL, I'm sure I'll get
    | different Amazon AWS servers than you might. The same goes for Facebook, 
    | I'd guess.
  p That particular DNS A-record server 
    b m.agar.io
    |  actually serves up the 
    | interface. See 
    a(href="https://outsourcedguru.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/hacking-agar-io-part-2/",target="_blank") my earlier blog entry
    |  on this API. Knowing this, you 
    | can intercept the communications and serve up your own m.agar.io 
    | server if you'd like. You might do this if you want to control game 
    | play in local party mode and yet still do FFA play. See the blog entry 
    | to read how I've done this before.
  p Additionally, if you are running a local Agar game server then by controlling 
    | the DNS you can easily point local people to your server.
  p Next, I'll probably work up a man-in-the-middle gateway server which gets 
    | requests from the game, uses curl to submit the response to the real 
    | server, interpret/change the result and send it back to the client (game). 
    | I'm guessing I ought to be able to manipulate coins as some of the people 
    | are doing.
  p Additionally, I would like to run another server which will voyeur the game 
    | in progress and display the entire game grid, say, on a companion 
    | computer. In this way, you would be able to see the "big picture" and 
    | to immediately tell where you are in the game, where trouble is, etc.
  p And finally, I think the man-in-the-middle would allow you to more easily 
    | serve up minions now that you know which game server you'd be attached 
    | to.
  p &nbsp;
  h3 When you're done
  hr
  p Dont' forget to put your game computer's DNS settings back to the way they 
    | were when you started. It's easy to forget and then think that your 
    | Internet is wonky.
  p If you're like me and you play on an iPad, I've found the easiest way is 
    | just to "Forget This Network" for my wi-fi zone and then add it back. 
    | It will re-learn your DNS information automatically.
